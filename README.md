Hi! I'm a developer, FOSS-enthusiast and a rationalist (not exclusive nor ordered). I'm a big fan of typed languages, making things work right, and helping. I _still_ think the golden age of software is ahead of us.

You can checkout my [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/max-arturo-alcala) for all the gory details – I originally started coding via Excel macros, automating myself out of tedious supply chain spreadsheets and picking up a copy of `Programming Basic: For Dummies`. Since then, I've accrued a storied professional past as a developer; ranging from small-to-medium startups in all sorts of hands-on roles (anything from IC to Tech lead) all the way to the Big Enterprise where I'd help hire people, lead product folks to see the Light, and wear all sorts of funny-looking hats as a "Principal Engineer".

I strive to be kind, compassionate and pay it forward.

I currently spend my time helping a couple of OSS packages I enjoy using, as well as feeling my way around Common Lisp. Feel free to reach out to me via [email](mailto:my-git-hub-username@gmail.com). Please mention bread in the email - I _love_ bread.
